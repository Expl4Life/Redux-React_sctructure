// actions are where most of the business logic takes place
// they are dispatched by views or by other actions
// there are 3 types of actions:
//  async thunks - when doing asynchronous business logic like accessing a service
//  sync thunks - when you have substantial business logic but it's not async
//  plain object actions - when you just send a plain action to the reducer
